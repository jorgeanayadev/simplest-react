        We can pass data to the function components using attributes and it is passed to the Link function as and argument
        <Link attributeName="value" /> 
       
        React collects and organizes the data passed to a given component as a single object.
        The name for data passed to a component, such as title, is props.
        All prop values exist within the function component itself on a props object.

          Make and array of objects and pass down the link components through props. 
          Since this is a common pattern in React, it has its own method .map() that works with JSX 
          (don't confuse with JS array.map() it's similar but Reacts works only for JXS)
